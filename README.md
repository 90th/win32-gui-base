# win32-gui-base

## Description
win32-gui-base is a simple bare GUI base designed to help users get started with Win32 GUI programming. It provides a foundation for building graphical user interfaces using the Win32 API in C++. Please note that this project is still in development, and there are some limitations. Users will need to implement most of the GUI elements themselves and handle aspects such as the size of elements and window size.

## Files

1. **drawing.cpp:** This file contains the implementation of the Drawing class, which is responsible for drawing text onto the main window using the Win32 API. The `DrawLoremIpsumText` method demonstrates how to draw Lorem Ipsum text on the window and can be extended to draw other UI elements.

2. **main.cpp:** This file contains the main entry point of the application. It initializes the main window, creates an instance of the Drawing class, and draws Lorem Ipsum text on the window. Developers can use this file as a starting point to create and manage UI elements within their applications.

3. **ui.cpp:** This file contains the implementation of the UI class, which handles the initialization of the main window and event processing. It also defines the `WindowProc` function, which is responsible for handling window messages such as `WM_SIZE` and `WM_DESTROY`.

## Usage
To use win32-gui-base as a template for your Win32 GUI application, follow these steps:

1. Identify the UI elements you want to add to your application, such as buttons, labels, and text boxes.
2. Define classes for each type of UI element, encapsulating their properties and functionality.
3. Implement drawing methods within each UI element class to visually represent the element on the form.
4. Use the constructor of the UI element class to create instances of the elements, specifying their position, size, and other attributes.
5. Add logic to handle user interactions and events for each UI element, such as button clicks or text input.
6. Utilize the Drawing class to draw the elements onto the main window by calling appropriate drawing methods within the `DrawLoremIpsumText` method or other drawing functions.
7. Organize the placement of elements on the form by specifying their coordinates or using layout management techniques.
8. Test the UI elements thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected and respond correctly to user input.
9. Iterate on the design and functionality of the UI elements based on user feedback and application requirements.

## Note to Developers
This project serves as a starting point for Win32 GUI development in C++. Developers are encouraged to customize and extend the code to suit their specific requirements. Refer to the provided code, documentation, and comments for further guidance and assistance in creating and placing elements onto the form.
